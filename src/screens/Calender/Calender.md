# Pending Issues In Calender Screen

## Overview

There are a couple of pending issues that require attention in the project. Please follow the instructions below to address these issues effectively.

## 1. Firebase Setup for Notifications

### Description

Local and full-screen notifications depend on Firebase integration. It's crucial to ensure that the Firebase file is properly configured to enable the pushing of notifications. Additionally, modifications need to be made in `Cardsheet.js` when a user marks a task as completed.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Firebase Configuration:**
   - Make sure you have a Firebase project set up.
   - Configure the Firebase file with the necessary credentials in your project.

2. **Modify Cardsheet.js:**
   - Navigate to the `Cardsheet.js` file.
   - Implement the required changes to handle notifications when a user completes a task.

```javascript
// Example modification in Cardsheet.js
// ... existing code

const handleTaskCompletion = (taskId) => {
  // Perform the task completion logic
  // ...

  // Trigger Firebase notification
  // Implement the code to send a notification
};

// ... remaining code
```

## 2. Update Fetch Event after User Profile Update

### Description

There is an outstanding issue where user profiles are not updating the fetch event. Files dependent on this issue include `NewTask.js` when saving the event, `TaskStack.js`, and the `AppHeader` component.

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Update NewTask.js:**
   - In the `NewTask.js` file, ensure that the fetch event is updated after saving a new task.

```javascript
// Example modification in NewTask.js
// ... existing code

const saveTask = async (taskData) => {
  // Save the task to the database
  // ...

  // Trigger a fetch event update
  await updateFetchEvent();
};

// ... remaining code
```

2. **Update TaskStack.js and AppHeader Component:**
   - In the `TaskStack.js` file and the `AppHeader` component, make sure to handle the fetch event appropriately after user profile updates.

```javascript
// Example modification in TaskStack.js
// ... existing code

const handleProfileUpdate = () => {
  // Handle the user profile update
  // ...

  // Trigger a fetch event update
  updateFetchEvent();
};

// ... remaining code
```



## Important Note

Please note that modifying the reminder card height may impact the overall layout and styling of the component. Ensure that any changes are thoroughly tested in different scenarios to maintain a consistent user interface.
